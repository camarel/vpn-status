#VPN status page

A simple page to display if the VPN is up and running or not.


## Installation

The files from the www directory go directly into the /www folder on the OpenWRT router.

Maybe a 'chmod +x' for the script /www/cgi-bin/vpnstatus is needed.


## Usage

To access the status page, simply go to your routers IP address, followed by /vpnstatus.html.

Example:
http://192.168.1.1/vpnstatus.html
